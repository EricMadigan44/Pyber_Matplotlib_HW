# Pyber_Matplotlib_HW

# Observations: 
1. Urban areas have the greatest amount of total rides and is the most popular area for Pyber. 
2. Suburban areas fall in between urban and rural areas in both average per fare and the total number of rides per area. Rides in Suburban areas are more expensive than rural areas rides but there are far less rides in Suburban areas then there are in Rural.
3. Rural areas have the highest fare which makes sense because most drives in rural area will take much more time than drives in a Urban or Suburban area.
